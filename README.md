# Sandbox
A portfolio of my iPython notebooks for learning and teaching various concepts

1 - A demonstration of a Monte Carlo method to price vanilla call options using Python and the equality with the Black Scholes closed form solution.
2 - A demonstration of Gradient Descent to execute a linear regression

Helpful tips for setting up iPython:
To configure where iPython Notebook saves / hosts files locally refer to this link:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18901185/ipython-notebook-save-location

Check what directories are currently available in the search path of Python:
import sys
for line in sys.path: print line

Add directories to this search path temporarily:
sys.path.append("C:\\Users\\Example\...\Example")
This is not permanent!

To add directories permanently, follow this link:
